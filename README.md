## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Alex Baker!

I am a recent grad from the University of Florida with a bachelors degree in electrical engineering.
I am currently looking for a job in industry working with electronics, hardware design, or electrical integration.

My interests are mainly in electronics, but I enjoy tinkering with mechanical devices just as much. Power electronics, digital circuits, analog devices, vacuum tubes, I have done a little bit of everything. Not everything I try is a success, but a failure is just as valuable a learning experience as a success is.
